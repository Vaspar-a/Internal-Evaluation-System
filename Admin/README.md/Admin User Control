Admin has 3 things to do.

1) Assign subject to evaluator along with college, department, semester, subject name, subject code, deadline to submit the report and 
   describing if the subject is only theory based or practical base or both.
   
2) Now the admin has to add student details (only name and id) for a given department and sem, so that the corresponding evaluator can 
   evaluate the marks of these students. Here admin can upload details from a excel sheet and can even download it later. He/She can even
   add it row by row but it's quite tedious as admin has to press ENTER key after writing data in every cell. So, it is recommended to 
   upload data using excel sheets only. To update data cell manipulation can be used. To update data of a cell double-click on it and then 
   click enter after the cell is updated.
   
3) Now, after evaluator finalizes report admin can finally view. But he cannot edit. If evaluator finds any mistake after finalizing the 
   report, he/she can contact admin after which admin will again send the report for reevaluation. Admin can save the report generated by 
   the evaluator as pdf.
   
   Admin can change his/her password form settings.
   
Note: Please select necessary fields in sequence(up->down then left->right) or else you may encounter(less chances) some kind of error.
      Also, while selecting fields keep in mind that such deptand sem data exist. Eg. evaluator is added for computer dept 2 sem and 
      civil dept 4 sem. Then while adding students or viewing reports don't give input as comp dept 4 sem or civil dept 2 sem! That may 
      also cause bug.
