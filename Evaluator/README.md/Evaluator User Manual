Evaluator has 3 things to do.

1) Set pedagogy for the assigned subject. There are 8 types of different pre defined exam styles. Just enter the marks of that particular
   field and whta fraction of marks(fraction>=0 & fraction<=1) will be considered in the final report.
   Eg. Viva contains 15 marks and only 10% of the marks scored will be considered. So fraction=0.1.
   Note: Internal Marking System is of 30 marks only.
   On clicking enter on any of the mark or fraction field it will show the total marks on adding fractionated marks, out of 30 in the upper
   right corner.
   To finalize pedagogy press Submit button given in the bottom right corner.
   => Use UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT arrow keys to navigate through marks & fraction fields.
   
2) After creating pedagogy, add marks for the students by clicking on the evaluation tab. Here, select department and sem student data will
   be shown. Enter marks for each student and on completion press ENTER Key(on the marks field) or Submit button. Once marks for all the 
   students are entered press Finalize button in the bottom right corner. After pressing Finalize button evaluator can niether change marks 
   nor pedagogy. Also, report is generated and viewed by evaluator & admin, only after pressing Finalize button. If evaluator finds any
   mistake after finalizing the report, he/she can contact admin after which admin will again send the report for re-evaluation.
   => Use UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT arrow keys to navigate through marks fields.
   => Use "n" key to enter marks for next student,"p" key to enter marks for previous student & "f" to find a student using his/her id only.
   Note: On using n/p/f keys it will print n/p/f in the textbox. So just press backspace after using n/p/f keys.
   
3) Now, after evaluator finalizes report evaluator & admin can finally view but cannot edit it. If evaluator finds any mistake after 
   finalizing the report, he/she can contact admin after which admin will again send the report for re-evaluation. Admin & evaluator can 
   save the report generated by the evaluator as pdf.
   
   Evaluator can change his/her password form settings.
   
Note: Please select necessary fields in sequence(up->down then left->right) or else you may encounter(less chances) some kind of error.
      Also, while selecting fields keep in mind that such deptand sem data exist. Eg. evaluator is added for computer dept 2 sem and 
      civil dept 4 sem. Then while adding students or viewing reports don't give input as comp dept 4 sem or civil dept 2 sem! That may 
      also cause bug.
      
      In DBConnection.java file add the DB-IP, Port No, HostName & Password
